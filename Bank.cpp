 * function DRAM model
 *
 * A vector of size NUM_COLS keeps a linked list of rows and their
 * associated values.
 *
 * write() adds an entry to the proper linked list or replaces the
 * 	value in a row that was already written
 *
 * read() searches for a node with the right row value, if not found
 * 	returns the tracer value 0xDEADBEEF
 * 
 *	TODO: if anyone wants to actually store data, this should be changed to an STL unordered_map
